# End-to-End Credit Risk Prediction: Mitigating Loss and Maximizing Profit in P2P Investments
_by Bashara Aina_

This project aims to develop an end-to-end solution for credit risk prediction in collaboration with a lending company during my internship as a Data Scientist at ID/X Partners. The objective is to create a machine learning model that can effectively identify potentially bad or risky loans, providing valuable insights for investment decision-making.

* Problem:
  As investors in P2P platforms, we face the risk of loans being charged off or defaulted, resulting in financial   losses. The challenge at hand is to develop a reliable system that can accurately predict the credit risk        associated with loans, allowing us to minimize our losses.

* Business Metrics:
  The success of our solution will be measured by two key business metrics: loss and net profit margin. By accurately identifying and avoiding risky loans, we aim to reduce overall losses and improve our net profit margin.

* Solution Explanation:
  To address the problem, we will leverage machine learning algorithms and utilize a comprehensive dataset provided by the lending company. The dataset consists of historical loan data from the Lending Club, covering the period between 2007 and 2014. By analyzing this data, we will build a predictive model that can assess the credit risk of new loan applications.

* Approach:
  To ensure simplicity and practicality, we will focus on non-parametric algorithms that require fewer assumptions. This approach allows us to develop a reliable model without extensive statistical expertise. Our end-to-end solution will involve various stages, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.

*  Deliverables:
   As part of our project, we will prepare clear and concise visual media to present our solution to the lending company. These visualizations will effectively communicate our findings and insights, aiding in decision-making processes.

By successfully implementing this end-to-end solution, we aim to minimize financial losses by avoiding risky   loans and increase our net profit margin in P2P platforms. This collaborative effort between ID/X Partners and Rakamin Academy showcases our commitment to applying data science methodologies in real-world scenarios, driving meaningful outcomes.
